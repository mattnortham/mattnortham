### Hi ðŸ‘‹

What's here are a few public personal projects, but what's not here are the many private actual work or the work that's on bitbucket or azure devops. Obviously. What I'm saying is: I'm much more active than my contributions graph indicate. gitflow on the downlow ðŸ‘€

I'm much more publically active on [https://www.mattnortham.com](https://www.mattnortham.com) or on twitter [@mattnortham](https://twitter.com/mattnortham).
